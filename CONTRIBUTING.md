# Contributing Guidelines

Just clone the repository and you are ready to go.

- Plagarism is strongly discouraged and your own contributions will be most valuable.
- Strictly use `snake_case (underscore_separated)` in your `file_name` and push it in correct folder.
- Just mention the issue against which the pull request is open by writing `Fixes #(your issue number)` in the description of the pull request
- Check for `always-open` labelled issues.
- Each issue has a number of sub-tasks you can take one of them and open your own issue for a single sub task, and then can send a PR for a particular sub-task.
- If you want to contribute for an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
- Please add your contributions to this repository under proper folder in `/docs`.

## Guidelines for code base :

- Use **1 tab or 4 spaces** indentation.
- Add the **description** of your algorithm using multi-line comments at the starting of the code.
- Add **comments** to your code in a **new line** and use single-line comments with **1 tab or 4 spaces** indentation.
- Add **minimum 2 test cases** along with input and output at the end of your code using multi-line comments.
- Also, add **time** and **space complexity** at the end of your code using multi-line comments.

## Follow the below template for adding a new algorithm

    # Algorithm Name

    # Algorithm Pseudocode
    # Code
        ## Language1 implementation
        ## Language2 implementation
        ...
    # Sources (if any)
    # Conclusion (if any)
