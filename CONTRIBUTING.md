# Contributing Instructions

Just clone the repository and you are ready to go.

- Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources like GFG,hackerearth, etc because that work will not be considered. **Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.**
- You can only work on issues that you have been assigned to you.
- Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in correct folder.
- Just mention the issue against which the pull request is open by writing `Fixes #(your issue number)` in the description of the pull request
- Check for `always-open` labelled issues.
- Each issue has a number of sub-tasks you can take one of them and open your own issue for a single sub task, and then can send a PR for a particular sub-task.
- If you want to contribute for an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
- Wait for the issue to be labelled, in the mean time you can start working on the algorithm and add it to the repository under proper folder in `/docs`.

## Guidelines for code base :

- Use **1 tab or 4 spaces** indentation.
- Add the **description** of your algorithm using multi-line comments at the starting of the code.
- Add **comments** to your code in a **new line** and use single-line comments with **1 tab or 4 spaces** indentation.
- Try to make your code **user input**.
- Add **minimum 2 test cases** along with input and output at the end of your code using multi-line comments.
- Also, add **time** and **space complexity** at the end of your code using multi-line comments.

## Follow the below template for adding a new algorithm

    # Algorithm Name
    # Algorithm Description
    # Algorithm Pseudocode
    # Code
        ## Language1 implementation
        ## Language2 implementation
        ...
    # Sources (if any)
    # Conclusion (if any)

See the example of [Selection sort](docs/sorting/selection_sort.md) before contributing.

The value of a strong contribution stays beyond everything and gives you satisfaction üëç.
