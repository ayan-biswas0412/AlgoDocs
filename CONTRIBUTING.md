# Contributing Instructions

Just clone the repository and you are ready to go.

1. See the issue section
2. Check for `always-open` labelled issues.
3. Check the algorithms which are not check marked.
4. Open a new issue based on a non-check marked algorithm.
5. Wait for the issue to be labelled, in the mean time you can start working on the algorithm and add it to the repository under proper folder in `/docs`.

## Follow the below template for adding a new algorithm

    # Algorithm Name
    # Algorithm Description
    # Algorithm Pseudocode
    # Code
        ## Language1 implementation
