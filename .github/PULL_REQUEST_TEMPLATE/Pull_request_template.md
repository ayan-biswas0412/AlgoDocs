## To raise the `Pull Request`

1. Make 1 `Pull Request` for 1 `issue`. Otherwise, you may lose points.

2. Mention `Issue number` while creating Pull Request in the `description box` or link the issue from the right options. This helps to link the PR with the respective issue.

3. Always update the readme for the respective code added in the appropriate folder.

4. Always take `Dynamic Input` from the user.

5. `Avoid Plagiarism` Never copy from other websites.

6. `Merge your commits` when changes requested.


## To raise a `valid Issue`

1.  Do `not` create `duplicate issues`.
2.  Always look for issues previously created before creating an issue of a particular topic. (`Use Filters`)
3.  All issues are assigned on `First Come, First Serve Basis`.
