# Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
We maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in the shortest-path tree, other set includes vertices not yet included in the shortest-path tree. At every step of the algorithm, we find a vertex that is in the other set (set of not yet included) and has a minimum distance from the source.

## Algorithm

```
Algorithm 
Step 1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in the shortest-path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from the source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty. 
Step 2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first. 
Step 3) While sptSet doesn’t include all vertices 
….a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has a minimum distance value. 
….b) Include u to sptSet. 
….c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if the sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.

## Pseudocode

```
Dijkstra_Algorithm(source, G):
    """
    parameters: source node--> source, graph--> G
    return: List of cost from source to all other nodes--> cost
    """
    unvisited_list = []			// List of unvisited verticesvertices
    cost = []
    cost[source] = 0              // Distance (cost) from source to source will be 0
    for each vertex v in G:       // Assign cost as INFINITY to all vertices
       if v ≠ source
             cost[v] = INFINITY
             add v to unvisited_list    // All nodes pushed to unvisited_list initially

    while unvisited_list is not empty:        	     // Main loop
       v = vertex in unvisited_list with min cost[v]      // v is the source node for first iteration
       remove v from unvisited_list		            // Marking node as visited 

       for each neighbor u of v:			// Assign shorter path cost to neigbour u
          cost_value = Min( cost[u], cost[v] + edge_cost(v, u)]
          cost[u] = cost_value            		// Update cost of vertex u 

    return cost

```

### C++ Implementation

```cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#include <limits.h>

// Number of vertices in the graph
#define V 9

// A utility function to find the vertex with minimum distance value, from
// the set of vertices not yet included in shortest path tree
int minDistance(int dist[], bool sptSet[])
{

	// Initialize min value
	int min = INT_MAX, min_index;

	for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)
		if (sptSet[v] == false && dist[v] <= min)
			min = dist[v], min_index = v;

	return min_index;
}

// A utility function to print the constructed distance array
void printSolution(int dist[])
{
	cout <<"Vertex \t Distance from Source" << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
		cout << i << " \t\t"<<dist[i]<< endl;
}

// Function that implements Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm
// for a graph represented using adjacency matrix representation
void dijkstra(int graph[V][V], int src)
{
	int dist[V]; // The output array. dist[i] will hold the shortest
	// distance from src to i

	bool sptSet[V]; // sptSet[i] will be true if vertex i is included in shortest
	// path tree or shortest distance from src to i is finalized

	// Initialize all distances as INFINITE and stpSet[] as false
	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
		dist[i] = INT_MAX, sptSet[i] = false;

	// Distance of source vertex from itself is always 0
	dist[src] = 0;

	// Find shortest path for all vertices
	for (int count = 0; count < V - 1; count++) {
		// Pick the minimum distance vertex from the set of vertices not
		// yet processed. u is always equal to src in the first iteration.
		int u = minDistance(dist, sptSet);

		// Mark the picked vertex as processed
		sptSet[u] = true;

		// Update dist value of the adjacent vertices of the picked vertex.
		for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)

			// Update dist[v] only if is not in sptSet, there is an edge from
			// u to v, and total weight of path from src to v through u is
			// smaller than current value of dist[v]
			if (!sptSet[v] && graph[u][v] && dist[u] != INT_MAX
				&& dist[u] + graph[u][v] < dist[v])
				dist[v] = dist[u] + graph[u][v];
	}

	
	printSolution(dist);
}


int main()
{

	int graph[V][V] = { { 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0 },
						{ 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 0 },
						{ 0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2 },
						{ 0, 0, 7, 0, 9, 14, 0, 0, 0 },
						{ 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0 },
						{ 0, 0, 4, 14, 10, 0, 2, 0, 0 },
						{ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 6 },
						{ 8, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7 },
						{ 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0 } };

	dijkstra(graph, 0);

	return 0;
